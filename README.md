# MSPM0 SVDs

This repository contains SVD files for the MSPM0L and MSPM0G series of Cortex-M0+ MCUs with patches fixing some issues.

The goal of this project is mostly to keep track of changes and provide a source of patched SVDs which can then be used to build
rust PACs with svd2rust or zig files with regz, but is not tied to either.
